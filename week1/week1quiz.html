    <h2>Write a paragraph or so on what your can do with JavaScript:</h2>
    <p>With Javascript, you are able to create a more dynamic experience for the user based on their interactions with the page and their context. You can serve different content to different devices, mobile vs. desktop (and everything in between). You can change content based on a user interaction. Clicking or hovering over an image could change what image is shown, or clicking on/hovering over a menu could expand or collapsed a sub-menu. There are also tons of libraries written in javascript to aid the web developer in creating powerful web apps.</p>
